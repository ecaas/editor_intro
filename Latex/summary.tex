\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
Here we present a new method for validating NWP model simulations in complex terrain with state-of-the-art observations. Specifically, we investigated how the model simulations from MET Norway's ensemble forecast product MEPS and two additional simulations with modified cloud microphysics schemes (CTRL and ICE-T) compared to observations and retrieved values. This study evaluated the model performance for 27 precipitation days by comparing simulated accumulated snowfall, SWC, and SWP to measurements at the HTS in Southern Norway.
