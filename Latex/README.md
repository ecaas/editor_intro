# LaTeX example for master thesis 

The example is based on the Latex package [***duomasterforside***](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/tjenester/it/hjelp/latex/duomasterforside-guide.pdf) by Dag Langmyhr.

The main file is `McS_thesis_MetOs.tex`.
It can be run within the terminal as follows and requires having LaTex installed:
```
$ pdflatex McS_thesis_MetOs.tex
$ bibtex McS_thesi_MetOs.tex
$ pdflatex McS_thesis_MetOs.tex
$ pdflatex McS_thesis_MetOs.tex
```

For VS code, it is necessary to have [LaTeX Worshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) installed, then you can run the LaTeX file interactively.
