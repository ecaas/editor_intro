# Introduction to the editors: Atom and Visual Studio Code
Good editors can speed up productivity while you develop models or explore data. Editors are good at highlighting syntax in your programming language, use git, debug, and compile programs. Furthermore, the appearance can be customized to your needs.

The two editors here presented are freely available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Both have extensions/plug-ins to make the editor more customizable. You can have multiple projects open simultaneously, autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and you can use version control in both editors. 

In summary, every editor has its own benefits. Any of the two will be fine. You still need to get your hands on to get familiar with using the editor. We will give you a quick introduction to Atom and VS code, and several more thorough tutorials are available online:
