# Python example on how to use Atom or VS code
This python example is based on Visualize in Python for the Climate science at high latitudes: eScience for linking Arctic measurements and modeling course in Abisko, 2019. 
The example can be found on [Github](https://github.com/daliagachc/negi-stuff/blob/master/negi_stuff/presentations/intro_jlab/02-_sub_Sara.ipynb).

## File description
Use the [requirement](environment_requirements.yml) file to create a virtual environment with the necessary packages to reproduce the example. 

The [imports.py](imports.py) file includes all imports needed for the exercise. To keep everything structured and clear during the developing process, separate package imports and, for example, functions from the main script.

[Visualization_in_JupyNb.ipynb](Visualization_in_JupyNb.ipynb) is the Jupyter notebook which includes the example. A copy of this can also be found in [Visualization_in_JupyNb.py](Visualization_in_JupyNb.py).
